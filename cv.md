# My main goal is to learn as much as possible and become successful software engineer. I always try to learn new things(especially things, which are connected into the technologies), therefore I think that the key of success is to learn essential and most demanded things.

# Progamming/Markup languages -  HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, Python, Oracle SQL, SQL lite, React JS(basics)

# I have successfully finished RS school mentorship program once time, but I didn't get a job offer, so I have worked a lot of projects during this course, for example: sites with HTML/CSS, calculator, virtual keyboard.

# Education - Now I am studying in Business And Technology University(BTU) on informational technologies. I watch tutorials, reading programming books, also I am making codewars tasks every day.
